# [Project 1: Adult Salary Classification Project Overview:](https://github.com/DhruvG17/Census_Adult_Salary)
* Created a classifer that estimates if an individual's salary is either above or below $50,000 annually with an accuracy rate of 84 percent. 
* Downloaded the data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income
* Engineered features by creating dummy variables for the categorical features used in the algorithm and improved the imbalance in the training data since the percentage of indivituals making under $50,000 annually was far exceeding the percentage making over $50,000. 
* Used kfold and cross validation to select the best models. 
* Implemented the best models and evaluated the performance of those models on the test data. 

# [Project 2: Medical Cost Linear Regression Project Overview:](https://github.com/DhruvG17/Medical_Costs)
* Created a linear regression model that estimated the data with an r2 score of 0.8775 and a mean absolute error of 2778. 
* Downloaded the data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance
* Did feature engenieering to turn categorical features into numerical ones, so they could be used in the linear regression algorithm 
* Turned my features into polynomial features for more accuracy

# [Project 3: Cardio Good Fitness Project Overview:](https://github.com/DhruvG17/CardioGoodFitness)
* Created a classifier that predicts the cardio machine an individual is likely to buy with an accuracy rate of 80 percent and an f1 score of 0.84
* Downloaded the data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/saurav9786/cardiogoodfitness
* Used data visulization and exploratory data analysis to come up with a customer profile for each machine 
* Used sklearn's label encoder to encode the target column 
* Implemented 4 machine learning algorithms and evaluated each one of them
